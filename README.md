    sudo groupadd docker
    sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
    su -s ${USER}
    docker run hello-world

Check and disable in case ports 80 and 443 are already in use (`service nginx stop` or any other running server).

- clean.sh : removes ft_server container and ft_server image
- o-clean-container.sh : force remove ft_container
